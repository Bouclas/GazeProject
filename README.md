# GazeProject

The first stage of a project idea of mine! The code of this stage enables detecting and tracking the pupils of the eyes.
Code was implemented in Matlab, and idea was based on the paper "  ". However, the method is affected by lighting conditions and tends to lose track of the eyes. 

But, given that was essentially implemented within a weekend, I'd say that it does the job.
